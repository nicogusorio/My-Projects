# Data Visualization Projects
This folder contains two published data visualization projects created using R and Python.

## Python Project: https://rpubs.com/nicogu/1294661
This project analyzes U.S. traffic accident data using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal was to explore trends and patterns in accident frequency based on factors like location, time, and weather conditions.
The project involved:
- Data cleaning and organization using `dplyr`
- Visualizations with `ggplot2`, including pie charts, bar graphs, line plots, and heatmaps
- Analyzing how environmental and situational variables affect accident occurrences


 
## R Project: https://rpubs.com/nicogu/1277980
This project analyzes U.S. crime data using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis was conducted using R and focuses on uncovering patterns in traffic accidents and criminal incidents across different states and conditions.
The project involved:
- Data cleaning and organization using `dplyr`
- Creating multiple visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and line graphs
- Exploring how weather, time of day, and location relate to the frequency and severity of incidents


These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze real-world datasets using R and Python, draw meaningful insights from descriptive statistics, and communicate findings through clear, effective visualizations.
