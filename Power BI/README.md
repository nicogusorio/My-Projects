## Project Description

The dashboard provides key HR insights, including:  

- **Total Employees** – Overview of workforce size  
- **Gender Distribution** – Representation across the organization  
- **Promotion Readiness** – Insights into employees eligible for promotion  
- **Service Year Analysis** – Distribution of employees by tenure  
- **Job Level Distribution** – Breakdown of roles across levels  
- **Attrition by Job Role** – Identifying roles at higher turnover risk  
- **Average Age Across Positions** – Age distribution trends  

I implemented **custom DAX measures** to calculate metrics such as average age and promotion eligibility, ensuring accurate and meaningful analytics. Visualizations include KPI cards, bar charts, and pie charts to present HR data in a clear and actionable way.  

The main goal of this project was to enable HR teams to quickly identify patterns related to employee demographics, turnover risk, experience levels, and organizational structure.  

The report is **published on Power BI Service**, making it easily accessible online for stakeholders and decision-makers.
