# My-Projects

A collection of data analysis and visualization projects using Excel, Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI — created to showcase my skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visual presentation.

## Project Overview

This repository contains several stand-alone projects, each focusing on different datasets or analytical goals. The projects are organized into subfolders, such as:

-`Excel-Projects` — Structured sales and performance analysis using Excel. This includes category-based comparisons, profit evaluation, trend identification, and written insight summaries derived from pivot tables and aggregated data.  
- `Data-Visualization` — Python and R notebooks for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.  
- `Tableau-Project` — Tableau workbooks and interactive visual dashboards.  
- `Power-BI` — Interactive dashboards and business intelligence reports created in Power BI.

Each project includes documentation or README files explaining the workflow, analysis, tools used, and key insights.

## Purpose

- Apply theoretical knowledge from Data Analysis to real or simulated datasets.  
- Build a portfolio demonstrating technical skills across Excel, Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI.  
- Highlight the ability to interpret data, generate insights, and communicate findings effectively.

## Skills Showcased

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling messy or real-world data, missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.  
- **Statistical Analysis & Interpretation**: Using Excel, Python, and R to generate summary statistics, exploratory insights, and performance metrics.  
- **Visualization & Storytelling**: Creating charts, dashboards, and interactive visuals (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, time-series, etc.).  
- **Business Intelligence Tools**: Building structured dashboards in Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.  
- **Reproducibility & Organization**: Structured folders, documented workflows, and clear explanations for understanding or reproducing results.

## How to Use

Explore each project folder to review datasets, analysis files, and visual outputs. Projects are designed to demonstrate a structured, insight-driven approach to data analysis — focusing on clarity, business relevance, and professional presentation.
