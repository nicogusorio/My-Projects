# My-Projects

A collection of data analysis and visualization projects using Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI — created to showcase my skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visual presentation.

## Project Overview
This repository contains several stand-alone projects, each focusing on different datasets or analytical goals. The projects are organized into subfolders, such as:

- `Data-Visualization` — Python and R notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- `Tableau-Project` — Tableau workbook and visualizations.  
- `Power BI` — Interactive dashboard created in Power BI.

Each project includes documentation or README files explaining the workflow, analysis, and insights.

## Purpose
- Apply theoretical knowledge from Data Analysis to real or simulated datasets.  
- Build a portfolio demonstrating technical skills in Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI.  
- Highlight the ability to interpret data, draw actionable insights, and present them professionally.

## Skills Showcased
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling messy or real-world data, missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.  
- **Statistical Analysis & Interpretation**: Using Python and R to generate summary statistics, exploratory data analysis, and insights.  
- **Visualization & Storytelling**: Creating charts, dashboards, and interactive visuals (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, time-series, etc.).  
- **Multi-Tool Fluency**: Demonstrating versatility across Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI.  
- **Reproducibility & Organization**: Structured folders, documented code, and clear instructions for understanding or reproducing results.

## How to Use
Explore each project folder to see the datasets, scripts, and visuals. Projects are intended to show a clean, result-driven approach to data analysis rather than just plotting graphs.
